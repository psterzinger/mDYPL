# mDYPL
This repo contains all materials to the paper: *Maximum Diaconis & Ylvisaker penalized likelihood for high dimensional logistic regression: p/n → κ, arbitrary signal, arbitrary covariate covariance*.

- **Scripts**: All scripts to recreate the numerical results and plots in the paper. 
	- `AMP_DY.jl`: A julia module to compute the mDYPL estimator and to numerically find the state evolution parameters (μ,b,σ). 
- **Results**: Results here
- **mDYPL_supplementary.pdf**: Document with proofs of the results in the main paper, along with additional numerical results.
