# mDYPL
This repo contains all materials to the paper: *Maximum Diaconis & Ylvisaker penalized likelihood for high dimensional logistic regression: p/n → κ, arbitrary signal, arbitrary covariate covariance*.

- **Scripts**: All scripts to recreate the numerical results and plots in the paper. 
	- `AMP_DY.jl`: A module to compute the mDYPL estimator and to numerically find the state evolution parameters (μ,b,σ).

– **Results**: 
- **mDYPL_supplementary.pdf**: Document with further material to the examples and simulations of the paper and additional simulation studies.
